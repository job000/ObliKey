# Critical Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve customer user permissions and functionality issues.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Dashboard Axios Errors for Regular Users ✅
**Status:** Already working correctly
- Dashboard (`DashboardScreen.tsx`) does NOT fetch accounting data
- No axios errors should occur for CUSTOMER role users
- Only PT sessions and bookings are fetched for customers

### 2. Customers Cannot See Products in Shop ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/src/controllers/product.controller.ts`

**Changes:**
- Modified `getProducts()` method to automatically filter by `PUBLISHED` status for CUSTOMER role
- Modified `getProduct()` method to only show published products to customers
- Admins and trainers can still see all products regardless of status

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// In getProducts()
const isCustomer = userRole === 'CUSTOMER';
const statusFilter = isCustomer ? 'PUBLISHED' : (status || undefined);

// In getProduct()
const whereClause = isCustomer ? { status: 'PUBLISHED' as any } : {};
```

### 3. Customers Can Create Their Own Training Programs ✅
**Files Created:**
- `/backend/src/controllers/program.controller.ts` (NEW)
- `/backend/src/routes/program.routes.ts` (NEW)

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/src/index.ts` - Added program routes

**Features:**
- Customers can create programs for themselves
- Trainers/Admins can create programs for any customer
- Customers can only view/edit their own programs
- Trainers can view/edit programs they created
- Admins can view/edit all programs
- Full CRUD operations with proper permission checks

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/programs` - Get all programs (filtered by role)
- `GET /api/programs/:id` - Get single program
- `POST /api/programs` - Create program (customers can create for themselves)
- `PATCH /api/programs/:id` - Update program
- `DELETE /api/programs/:id` - Soft delete program
- `POST /api/programs/:id/exercises` - Add exercise to program
- `DELETE /api/programs/:id/exercises/:exerciseId` - Remove exercise

### 4. Customers Have Access to Classes ✅
**Status:** Already working correctly
- Class routes (`/backend/src/routes/class.routes.ts`) allow all authenticated users to:
  - `GET /api/classes` - View all classes
  - `GET /api/classes/:id` - View class details
- Booking routes (`/backend/src/routes/booking.routes.ts`) allow all authenticated users to:
  - `POST /api/bookings` - Book a class
  - `GET /api/bookings/my-bookings` - View own bookings
  - `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/cancel` - Cancel booking

### 5. PT Sessions Navigation to Shop Fixed ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/screens/EnhancedShopScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added route params handling to accept filter from navigation
- Maps `PT_SESSION` filter (from PTSessionsScreen) to `PT_SERVICE` (actual product type)
- Shop now correctly filters and shows PT service products when navigating from PT sessions

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Handle route params for filtering
  if (route?.params?.filter) {
    const filter = route.params.filter === 'PT_SESSION' ? 'PT_SERVICE' : route.params.filter;
    setFilterType(filter);
  }
}, [route?.params]);
```

### 6. Admin Publish/Unpublish Products ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/screens/ProductsManagementScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `handlePublishProduct()` function
- Added `handleUnpublishProduct()` function
- Added publish/unpublish buttons to product cards
- Buttons show conditionally based on product status
- Added styles for new buttons

**Features:**
- Publish button (green) appears for DRAFT/ARCHIVED products
- Unpublish button (amber) appears for PUBLISHED products
- Uses existing backend endpoints:
  - `POST /api/products/:id/publish`
  - `POST /api/products/:id/unpublish`

### 7. Chat Typing Indicator ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/src/controllers/chat.controller.ts` - Added typing indicator methods
- `/backend/src/routes/chat.routes.ts` - Added typing routes

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/chat/conversations/:conversationId/typing` - Set typing status
- `GET /api/chat/conversations/:conversationId/typing` - Get users currently typing

**Implementation:**
- Polling-based solution (no WebSocket required)
- Uses `typingAt` timestamp in `conversation_participants` table
- Auto-expires after 3 seconds
- Frontend already has TypingIndicator component in ChatScreen.tsx

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Database Migration Required:**
```sql
-- Add typingAt column to conversation_participants table
ALTER TABLE conversation_participants
ADD COLUMN "typingAt" TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

## Database Schema Changes Required

### For Typing Indicator Feature
Add the following column to the `conversation_participants` table:

```prisma
model ConversationParticipant {
  id             String    @id @default(uuid())
  conversationId String
  userId         String
  joinedAt       DateTime  @default(now())
  lastReadAt     DateTime?
  typingAt       DateTime? // NEW FIELD

  conversation Conversation @relation(fields: [conversationId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user         User         @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([conversationId, userId])
}
```

Run: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-typing-indicator`

## Frontend Integration Notes

### For Chat Typing Indicator
To implement on frontend (ChatScreen.tsx):

1. Add API methods to `/frontend/src/services/api.ts`:
```typescript
async setTypingIndicator(conversationId: string, isTyping: boolean) {
  return this.axiosInstance.post(`/chat/conversations/${conversationId}/typing`, { isTyping });
}

async getTypingUsers(conversationId: string) {
  return this.axiosInstance.get(`/chat/conversations/${conversationId}/typing`);
}
```

2. Update ChatScreen.tsx:
```typescript
// Debounced typing indicator
const typingTimeoutRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout>();

const handleTextChange = (text: string) => {
  setMessageText(text);

  // Send typing indicator
  if (selectedConversation) {
    api.setTypingIndicator(selectedConversation, true);

    // Clear after 2 seconds
    if (typingTimeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(typingTimeoutRef.current);
    }
    typingTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      api.setTypingIndicator(selectedConversation, false);
    }, 2000);
  }
};

// Poll for typing users
useEffect(() => {
  if (!selectedConversation) return;

  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    const response = await api.getTypingUsers(selectedConversation);
    setIsTyping(response.data.length > 0);
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [selectedConversation]);
```

## Summary

All issues have been addressed:
1. ✅ Dashboard - No errors (already working)
2. ✅ Products - Customers can see published products
3. ✅ Programs - Customers can create their own programs
4. ✅ Classes - Customers have full access (already working)
5. ✅ PT Shop - Navigation filter fixed
6. ✅ Publish/Unpublish - Admin UI added
7. ✅ Typing Indicator - Backend ready (needs DB migration + frontend integration)

**Next Steps:**
1. Run database migration for typing indicator
2. Implement frontend typing indicator integration (optional)
3. Test all features thoroughly
